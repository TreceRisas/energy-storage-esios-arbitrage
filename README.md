# Energy Storage Arbitrage using ESIOS Data

This repository contains an academic analysis of the operation of an electrical energy storage system participating in the Spanish day-ahead electricity market.  
The study focuses on **energy arbitrage strategies** using real hourly price data obtained from **ESIOS (Red Eléctrica de España)** for the year 2024.

The project has been developed as part of a **Master’s level course in Energy Transport Infrastructures** and emphasizes methodological clarity, reproducibility, and transparent use of official market data.

## 📌 Overview

Electrical energy storage plays a key role in modern power systems by providing flexibility and enabling the integration of renewable energy sources.  
In markets with hourly price variability, storage systems can generate economic value by charging during low-price periods and discharging during high-price periods.

In this project:
- Real hourly market prices are downloaded from ESIOS.
- Representative daily scenarios are selected based on price volatility.
- A linear optimization model is used to compute the optimal charge/discharge schedule.
- Daily results are extrapolated to estimate annual revenues for different storage capacities.

## 🧠 Methodology

The analysis follows these main steps:

1. **Data acquisition**  
   Hourly market prices are downloaded via the official ESIOS API.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Filtering by geographical area (Spain)
   - Time zone conversion from UTC to local time (Europe/Madrid)

3. **Scenario selection**  
   - Daily price statistics (mean and standard deviation) are computed
   - Days are classified into volatility quartiles
   - One representative day is selected per quartile

4. **Storage dispatch optimization**  
   - Linear programming formulation
   - Objective: maximize daily arbitrage profit
   - Constraints: power limits, energy capacity, state of charge balance

5. **Annual revenue estimation**  
   - Daily results are weighted to estimate annual income
